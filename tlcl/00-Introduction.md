In the late 1970s, the invention of the microprocessor allowed ordinary people to own computers, a revolutionary shift from the control previously held by big business and government. Today, while computers are ubiquitous, large corporations have gained control over them, limiting what users can do. However, people are fighting back by building Linux, a system that grants true freedom—control over your computer and full transparency about its operations, where nothing is hidden. Let’s explore how you can take back **control of your computer** using Linux.

### Why use Command Line?

In movies, "super hackers" often use the command line (CLI) instead of a mouse because it’s understood that the keyboard is the most efficient tool for serious computer work. While many modern users are familiar with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the command line is a powerful, expressive way to interact with a computer. Linux, modeled after Unix, inherits this robust CLI, which was developed before GUIs became common. The command line is ideal for performing complex tasks that GUIs cannot easily handle, making it a key feature for Linux users.

### What this Book is about?

This book offers a comprehensive guide to **mastering** the Linux command line, exploring how it works, what it can do, and how to use it effectively, while teaching you how to truly **live** in this powerful environment.It is not about Linux system administration, but it lays a solid foundation for those interested in further study. The book is specifically tailored to modern Linux distributions, with 95% of the content also applicable to other Unix-like systems, but it avoids the dilution of content by not covering other platforms like macOS or generic Unix.

### Audience

This book is for new Linux users transitioning from other platforms, particularly those familiar with Microsoft Windows. Whether you're tasked with administering a Linux server, exploring single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi, or just seeking a more secure desktop environment, this book is for you.

However, be aware that mastering the Linux command line takes effort. It's vast, with thousands of programs to learn, and requires dedication. While challenging, learning the command line is highly rewarding. You'll gain true power over your system, and the skills you acquire will remain valuable for years. No prior programming experience is necessary, as we'll guide you through that journey as well.

### What's in This Book

This book is structured to guide you through the Linux command line in a **logical sequence**, helping you adapt to the **Unix mindset**, which differs from Windows. It’s divided into four parts: Part 1 introduces the shell and basic command line concepts, Part 2 covers configuring the environment, Part 3 explores common tasks and essential tools for data manipulation, and Part 4 introduces shell scripting to automate tasks and develop transferable programming skills. Along the way, you'll gain insights into Linux's Unix roots and the rationale behind its design.

### How to Read this Book

To read this book, start from the beginning and progress through to the end, as it’s designed to be a continuous learning journey rather than a reference. You’ll need a working Linux installation, which can be set up by either installing Linux on a desktop computer (preferably Ubuntu, Fedora, or OpenSUSE) or using a Live CD/USB for testing compatibility. A desktop with at least 2 GB of RAM and 6 GB of free space is recommended. You’ll also need superuser privileges for some tasks. Once your setup is ready, follow along with the exercises and start typing to get hands-on experience.

### Why I Don't Call It 'GNU/Linux'

**Terminology Debate**: 
- The term “GNU/Linux” is used by some to reflect both the Linux kernel and the GNU Project's contributions.
- Technically, “Linux” refers to just the operating system kernel, not the full operating system.

**Role of Richard Stallman**:
- Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Movement and the Free Software Foundation.
- He created the GNU Project, wrote the first version of the GNU C Compiler (gcc), and authored the GNU General Public License (GPL).
- Stallman prefers using “GNU/Linux” to highlight the contributions of the GNU Project.

**Issues with "GNU/Linux" Naming**:
- The Linux kernel is essential but not the entire operating system; many other contributions from various developers form the complete OS.
- The term “GNU/Linux” may seem unfair to others who made significant contributions to the system outside of GNU.

**Technically Accurate Naming**:
- “Linux/GNU” would be more technically accurate as the kernel (Linux) boots first, with everything else running on top.

**Popular Usage**:
- In practice, "Linux" commonly refers to both the kernel and the entire ecosystem of open-source software in a Linux distribution.
- The use of single-word names like DOS, Windows, macOS, etc., is more common in the operating system marketplace.
